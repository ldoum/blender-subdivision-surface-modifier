# blender-subsurf-modifier-applier
Applies the subdivision surface modifier to all meshes selected in a batch.

The reason why I made this script was because I grew tired of adding the same modifier for every mesh object on my blockouts. 

This is a simple script.

Will make updates periodically.

Features so far:
1. Adds the modifier with specific name
2. Deletes the modifier by name
3. Erases all modifiers from each object at once.
4. Applies a modifier by name only
